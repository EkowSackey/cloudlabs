| 1. Operational Excellence | A two tier architecture has fewer moving parts. This makes it easy to deploy with lower operational overhead in early stages. | Might not have infrastructure as code and may be using manual provisioning. Lacking automation and observability mechanisms. | Implement Infrastructure as Code. Add centralized logging for observability as well as automated deployment pipelines.                     | Cloudwatch (metrics)       AWS Systems Manager        Cloud Formation |
| 2. Security               | Basic network isolation in place makes sure web server is on a public subnet but database is private.                         | The Database might not have encryption at rest.              Poor identity and access management.                            | Enforce principle of least privilege.

| 3. Reliability            | Separation of tiers provides some level of fault isolation.                                                                   | The central database and the web server may present a Single Point of Failure. No autoscaling implemented.                   | Deploy across multiple AZs.

| 4. Performance Efficiency | Separation of compute and database tiers allows independent scaling.                                                          | No Horizontal scaling, autoscaling or caching layer implemented. No read replicas in a two tier architecture.                | Add autoscaling groups for the web tier, add an application load balancer and enable read replicas. Serve static content using CloudFront. | AWS CloudFront. Elasticache                                           |
| 5.Cost Optimization       | Predictable and simple cost structure due to low complexity.                                                                  | No elasticity implemented. This may lead to overprovisioning just to be safe.                                                | Use Right-sizing to reduce the risk of overprovisioning. Use spot instances for non-critical workloads.                                    | AWS Compute Savings Plans. Cost Explorer.                             |

## Task 3: Cloud Adoption Framework

### 1. Business Perspective
The organization is technically motivated to migrate to AWS. They will need to formulate a defined business case with explicit linkages between cloud migration and their desired measurable outcomes such as reduced time-to-market, improved resilience, cost predictability or global scalability. A successful migration requires alignment with business objectives. Key actions required for this include developing a cloud value realization model, defining KPIs and identifying expected Return On Investments. Leadership sponsorship and clear funding models must also be established to prevent stalled transformation. Business alignment is needed to make sure the cloud migration doesn't end up being just a technical relocation but a strategic modernization initiative. 

### 2. People Perspective
The current environment suggests traditional infrastructure management skills focused on on-premises server administration. Cloud adoption requires a shift towards DevSecOps practices, Infrastructure as Code, automation and shared responsibility for security and operations. The organization needs to to move to close skill gaps that might exist in areas such as IAM design, monitoring, cost governance and resilience and reliability engineering. Key actions include structured cloud training programs, AWS certification pathways and the formation of cross-functional cloud teams. They will also need to transition teams from reactive operations to proactive automation-driven management. Investment in people capability is necessary for the technical architecture improvements to be sustainable in the long term. 

### 3. Governance Perspective
There is currently no evidence of formal cloud governance controls such as account structure strategy, tagging policies, cost allocation mechanisms or compliance frameworks. Governance strategies must be  put in place to make sure resources are not provisioned without guardrails, increasing the risk of cost inefficiency. The organization needs to implement AWS Organizations with Service Control Policies and establish tagging standards for cost tracking and resource ownership. Compliance requirements must be mapped to AWS Security controls. Financial governance should also be implemented to make sure cost is closely monitored. This will ensure scalability and prevent the growth of technical debt as the organization moves more onto the cloud.

### 4. Platform Perspective
The current two-tier architecture does not suggest a strong cloud-native platform strategy. There may be no existing automation frameworks or reusable infrastructure patterns and this might limit scalability and increase configuration drift risk. The organization should implement standardized VPC design, IAM roles, logging accounts and centralized monitoring to improve readiness. They should adopt Infrastructure as Code as well as managed services such as RDS instead of self managed technology in order to reduce the operational burden and improve reliability. This will enable repeatable, secure and scalable deployments on the cloud. 

### 5. Security Perspective
Security readiness currently appears to be reactive rather than embedded into design. Risks may include overly permissive security groups, lack of encryption policies, insufficient identity controls, and absence of threat detection tooling. Cloud security requires a shift to identity-first and automation-driven protection models. Key actions for security readiness include implementing least-privilege IAM policies, enforcing encryption at rest and in transit, enabling centralized logging, and deploying continuous threat detection. Security must integrate into CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps) rather than being applied post-deployment. Formal incident response playbooks should also be developed and tested. Cloud security maturity is essential because AWS operates under a shared responsibility model and misconfigurations remain the customer’s responsibility.

### 6. Operations Perspective

Operational readiness appears minimal beyond basic server management. There is no indication of monitoring strategy, automated remediation, incident management processes, or defined SLAs. In the cloud, operational excellence depends on observability, automation, and continuous improvement. The organization should implement centralized monitoring and logging, define alert thresholds, and automate scaling and failover mechanisms. Runbooks should be documented and tested. Metrics such as Mean Time to Recovery and deployment frequency should be tracked. Adopting CI/CD pipelines will also reduce operational friction and deployment risk. Without operational maturity, even well-designed architectures will degrade over time.
